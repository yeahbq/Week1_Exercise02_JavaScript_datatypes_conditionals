## Building and Referencing Objects

In today's exercise, we'll take what we've learned about JS objects and put it to work!

I've included a `starter_code` directory. *Make sure to copy the `starter_code` directory into your workspace before you start coding!*

#### <u>Model Yourself from Your Parents</u>

You'll **create yourself as an object**. You'll build your parents first, and then **build yourself by referencing their attributes**!

1. First build two objects `mom` and `dad` as object literals (e.g. `var mom = {}`). If you have a non-traditional family structure, just use someone everybody loves, like Joe Biden or Oprah.
2. Create one Physicality object and one Personality object for each parent (e.g. `mom.physicality = {}` and `mom.personality = {}`).
3. Using different data types (Number, String, Array, Object, Null, & Boolean), add **5 physical attributes** to each of your parents.
4. Do the same with the personality object!
5. Now build yourself by referencing physical and personality attributes from your folks!
6. Make 2 lists: first, what you're good at, and second, what you're bad at.
7. Age yourself.
8. Delete half of the things you were good at.
9. Age yourself (again).
10. Add `'sitting'` to the things you're good at and remove everything else from the list.
11. Add 5 more things to the list of things you're bad at.

**BONUS**: Create a method that prints out one of your classic sayings!

## More Practice!

If you finish this exercise, try one of these exercises! There's no starter code for these, so you can start from scratch 😀


#### <u>Become [Ash Ketchum](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ash_Ketchum)</u>

You are now a pokemon trainer. Yes, your middle school dreams (elementary school, maybe? okay, high school.) are now fulfilled. **Build Your starting six pokemon!**

1. Create each pokemon as an object literal.
2. Give each pokemon at least eight properties - be sure to use each data type in the properties (think `health: 500` or `moves: ['ice punch', 'friend chip', 'mega sneeze']`).
3. Give each pokemon a reference to another pokemon, in case they faint!
4. Create an array `myPokemon` and push or unshift each pokemon into the array in the order you choose.

**BONUS**: Give your pokemon a move as a method - make it remove an amount of HP from another pokemon foe!!

#### <u>Build a Pizza Menu</u>

Become the sweaty human behind the counter, make your menu, and start making some friggin' pizzas.

1. Create a menu object.
2. Create 5 pizzas, each referenced within the menu object as distinct properties (like `dailySpecial: {` fill this in on the next step `}`).
3. Give each pizza 6 properties.
4. Be sure to use each data type in the properties (think `calories: 5000`, `meat: null` or `preferredBy: 'vegetarians'`).

**BONUS**: Create a method on the menu object that prints to the console the entirety of the menu!
